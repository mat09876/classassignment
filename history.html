	<h2>About The Storehouse</h2>
	<p>Located in the heart of the St. James's Gate Brewery, 
	the Guinness StorehouseÂ® is Ireland's most popular tourist 
	attraction. It's the home of the Black Stuff, the heart of
	Dublin and an unforgettable start to your Irish adventure.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The journey begins at the bottom of the world's largest 
	pint glass and continues up through seven floors filled 
	with interactive experiences that fuse our long brewing 
	heritage with Ireland's rich history. At the top, you'll
	be rewarded with a pint of perfection in our world-famous
	rooftop Gravity Bar. Now that's our kind of higher education.
