			<div><p>Located in the heart of the St. James's Gate Brewery, 
			the Guinness Storehouse® is Ireland's most popular tourist 
			attraction. It's the home of the Black Stuff, the heart of
			Dublin and an unforgettable start to your Irish adventure.

			</p></div>
			<div><p>In 1759, at the age of 34, Arthur Guinness signed a 
			lease for the St. James’s Gate Brewery, Dublin. He leased the
			brewery for 9000 years at an annual rent of £45. The brewery 
			was only 4 acres in size, disused, and had little brewing 
			equipment. Despite this, Arthur quickly built up a successful
			trade and by 1769 he had begun to export his beer to England. 
			</p></div>

			
			<div><p>
			Arthur Guinness began by brewing ale at St. James’s Gate. In 
			the 1770s, he began brewing ‘porter’, a new type of English 
			beer, invented in London in 1722 by a brewer named Ralph 
			Harwood. Porter was different from ale because it was brewed 
			using roasted barley, giving the beer a dark ruby colour and 
			rich aroma. Arthur’s porter was successful and in 1799 he 
			decided to stop brewing ale altogether, and concentrate on 
			porter alone.		
			</p></div>

			<div><p>
			Arthur Guinness brewed different types of porter to suit different
			tastes, including a special export beer called ‘West India Porter’.
			This beer is still brewed today and is now known as GUINNESS 
			Foreign Extra Stout. It accounts for 45% of all GUINNESS sales
			globally and is popular in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. By the 
			time Arthur died in 1803, he had built a successful brewing business,
			with a promising export trade.
